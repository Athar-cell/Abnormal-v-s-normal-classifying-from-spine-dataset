🦴 Spine Condition Prediction using Machine Learning
📖 Overview
This project focuses on predicting spinal conditions using machine learning models. Spinal issues can significantly affect a person’s lifestyle, and early detection through data-driven insights can help in timely intervention and better treatment.
The dataset used in this project contains various biomechanical attributes related to the spine. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to classify whether a person’s spine is normal or shows signs of abnormalities.
The application is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface, making it easier for users to input values and get predictions instantly ⚡.
